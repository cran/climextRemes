0.2.2 (August 2020)

* fixed bug when using upperTail=FALSE in calc_riskRatio_pot and calc_riskRatio_gev.

* corrected naming of output when using lower tail rather than upper tail in various fitting functions.

* added some error trapping.

* fixed problem with Python interface under rpy2 >= 3.3.0.

* modified Python interface's Conda configuration to require pandas <= 0.25.3, since the rpy2 available for Conda is 2.9.4, which won't work with pandas >= 1.0.0

0.2.1 (May 2019)

* added ability to install Python version via pip.

* added compatibility for Python interface for rpy2 >= 3.0.0 (moving to NULLType from RNULLType and automatic conversion to numpy.ndarray when objects returned from R.

* fixed bug in return argument names of calc_logReturnPeriod_fevd.

* fixed bug that try-errors in fevd output not being caught properly in fit_gev or fit_pot; particularly affecting model fits with < 3 observations.

* fixed bug that resulted in the negative of the actual return values when using maxes=FALSE in fit_gev and upperTail=FALSE in fit_pot. Similarly fixed bug that initial values were not negated under the same circumstances before doing the fitting.

* cleaned up extraneous names in $returnValue and $returnValueDiff output.

* Python version now passes warnings produced in R back to the user.

* cleaned up Conda build recipe to be architecture- and Python-version independent. Things might not install smoothly under Python 2 however. 

* changed to modified BSD license and updated citation information.

0.2.0:

* added Koopman confidence interval method to 'calc_riskRatio_binom'.

* added various types of bootstrap confidence intervals (basic, percentile, BCA, bootstrap-t) to 'calc_riskRatio_binom', 'calc_riskRatio_gev', and 'calc_riskRatio_pot'.

* simplified optimization in likelihood-ratio-based confidence intervals for risk ratio.

* fixed a bug in remove_runs() that caused failure to remove any values when upperTail is FALSE; also fixed jittering amount to work regardless of magnitude of values.

* fixed bug in cases where 'x' provided to 'fit_pot' or 'fit_gev' but no regression functions specified.

* added Python version of all examples to Python front end.

* reworked help information for Python front end to show arguments in terms of Python syntax.

* added functionality to update R version from Python and keep Python and R versions in sync.

* forced R warnings to be printed in Python version.

* added Conda deployment information for Python version.

0.1.3:

* now allow users to request multiple return values or return periods (or differences of values or periods)  when using 'fit_gev' and 'fit_pot'.

* added user option to return return quantities (via 'getReturnCalcs'), parameter estimates (via 'getParams') and fitted model information (via 'getFit') from the fitted models in 'calc_riskRatio_gev' and 'calc_riskRatio_pot'.

* added user option 'logScale' to specify if scale should be fit on log scale

* added functionality to avoid standard error calculations of return quantities when fitting bootstrapped datasets to avoid unnecessary computation

* new error trapping to detect when names in formulae are not present in data 'x', 'xNew', or 'xContrast'

* added additional help information regarding convergence failures

0.1.2:

* added check that 'blockIndex' does not put one outside range of 'x', 'weights', or 'proportionMissing'

* added check for NA in 'blockIndex', 'x', 'xObs'

* report warning if risk ratio confidence interval optimization results in estimate of either endpoint of confidence interval equal to an endpoint of the interval (i.e., 'bounds' value) used for optimization

0.1.1: 

* first internal release
